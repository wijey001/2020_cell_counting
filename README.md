# 2021_cell_counting
> The scripts in this folder were developed for cell counting using ImageJ/FIJI. There are three primary scripts all written in the ImageJ Macro Language (IJM). They can be opened in the FIJI by dragging and dropping an .ijm file into the main menu, which will open the .ijm script editor in FIJI. From this window, the scripts can be edited and run with selected images.
